# Project-Gallery-P2

14th Febuary: Having already made a project, repo and folders for the project gallery back before I started work on Project 1, I now returned to layout a beginning structure for my project gallery.
Here I added some initial strucutre to my html file and created some <div class> tags that will prove useful in styling and organising the page.
15th Febuary: Now I know exactly how I want the gallery to look. I implemented some of the coding I have learnt while building my Hobby page.
The first thing was to add title text, a background image and a gradient to darken the image. I used some CSS code to position my background image to fit the entire page. The idea is that I will have that filling the screen, bold title text in the middle, left hand-side of the page. And Finally on the middle right, my clickable project tiles will be placed. I also added a font styling using the \* tag in CSS so that my page has nice text and is also consistent with my hobby page.
Now that I had made a clean start to this P2 and knew where I would be going, I decided to leave it for now as there many elements to add fix, add and learn on my hobby page.

March 1st: Now that my Hobby page is mostly finished with and only a few tweaks remain, it is time to make headway with my project gallery.
Today is about creating the overall structure by making the basic nav bar, creating divs for the title, nav bar and project tiles. One of the key takeaways I took from making the Hobby page was just how important it is to establish a clear and clean foundation. Without a clear platform from which to build and design off of, it can quickly become messy and confusing. So I wanted to approach this a bit more deliberately.
